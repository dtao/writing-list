Writing List
============

For some time now I've had a list of topics to write about scattered around,
some in notebooks, some in Evernote or Google Keep or elsewhere, some in emails
to myself.

This repository is just my attempt to collect all these ideas in one place, and
actually start working through them.

These are not prioritized (yet).

1. The 100-mile chainsaw
1. Being genuine is efficient
1. Communication contracts*
1. Complexity reducers
1. Fun is the whole point
1. Happiness is a byproduct
1. Hot soup and ice cubes
1. Morality is relative, not subjective
1. Plan for the best
1. The smart strategy is not the winning strategy
1. Sometimes you don't catch the exception
1. There are no realists
1. Trading off excellence
1. What if we didn't know it was hard?
1. What's an order of magnitude?
1. What you need to hear
